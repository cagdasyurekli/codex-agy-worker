# Security and compatibility

`agy-worker` is a Codex Agent Skill. It requires the OpenAI Codex CLI, Bash, Python 3,
Git, and the Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`). It is not a Claude or Claude Code skill.
Provider model slugs that contain `claude` describe a selectable provider model; they
do not make a Claude host supported.

## Execution boundaries

The skill helps Codex delegate repository work to `agy`; it does not transfer final
acceptance to the worker. Codex reviews the resulting diff and runs driver-owned
verification before reporting a result. A passing check is evidence for the command
that ran, not a general security or correctness guarantee.

`agy` is an external provider-backed CLI. Before dispatch, the operator must approve
the entire disposable worktree as worker-readable and potentially transmissible to the
provider. A narrower approval is valid only when that worktree contains only approved
content. Credentials, private keys, user-denied paths, unrelated private files, raw
worker logs, and local controller state must be absent from the worktree before every
provider launch. Prompt instructions and candidate-path gates do not provide read
isolation. Installation does not grant this approval.

Work happens in a disposable Git worktree, but that worktree is not a security sandbox.
The operator remains responsible for repository access, review, test selection, and
any credentials or network access available to commands they run.

Provider children and the dispatch-time `agy` version, help, and model-selection
probes receive only `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR`, and locale variables by default. Pass an
additional caller variable by exact name with repeated `--provider-env NAME`; the value
is read only at launch and is not written to the dispatch command or public status.
Startup and runtime injection variables such as `BASH_ENV`, `PYTHON*`, `LD_*`,
`DYLD_*`, `GIT_*`, and the gate's `AGY_WORKER_SCHEMA` selector cannot be opted in.

Other local utilities, including diagnostics and feedback-draft generation, are not
provider dispatch and are outside this environment-isolation guarantee.

Driver-owned verification uses the same closed baseline. Use repeated
`verify-job.sh --verify-env NAME` only when a chosen verifier genuinely needs an
additional caller variable. The authorized names are bound into the receipt policy
hash; their values cross a private descriptor into the trusted gate process, which
then builds the `env -i` verifier child environment. Values do not
enter the outer gate environment or stored receipt. A driver-owned
command can still import and execute unreviewed candidate code, so do not expose
credentials merely because the command itself is trusted.

Environment filtering is not filesystem, network, `PATH`, `HOME`, or same-user
process isolation. Candidate code may still read accessible files or use available
network paths; a green gate never replaces human diff review.

## Supported distribution

The canonical runtime lives in `skills/agy-worker/runtime/`. Repository-root scripts
are compatibility wrappers. The Codex marketplace package and GitHub installation path
refer to that one bundle; they do not create a second runtime or authorize a provider
dispatch.
